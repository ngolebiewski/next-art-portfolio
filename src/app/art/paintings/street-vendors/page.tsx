I start with a photograph of an everyday city scene. From that, I make my first painting — a gouache on paper. It’s vibrant. It’s time and labor intensive. The result evokes a kaleidoscope or stained glass or a still from a rotoscoped Richard Linklater film.\n\n\n
Then I take the same photo and go in a completely opposite route. I make a Xerox transfer, purposefully imperfect, that I then elaborate with pen & ink. Where the first painting was colorful, this one is stark black and white. Where the first painting required attentive detail, this one is the product of improvisation and imperfection.`} /> */}
