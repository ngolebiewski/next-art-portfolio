## Commissions

Nick Golebiewski accepts commissions for paintings in watercolor, gouache and egg tempera and for drawings in pen and ink, as well as embellished Xerox transfer works. Pricing is relative to size, style and complexity of subject, and optional services like source-image photography or framing. He is most known for making paintings of the buildings and places that have a special meaning to people, like the location that partners met, a childhood home, and important landscape, a historic building, the exterior storefront of a restaurant or bar...

## Events

Nick will paint your event! He’s painted at a wedding, an outdoor gala dinner, and from a rooftop event. He will complete a large scale watercolor painting on a scene-stealing french-impressionist style easel. Events local to NYC or will travel.

## Illustration

Nick often partners within the food industry for custom paintings, with multiple projects with Russ & Daughters for example.

## Classes
