## "Nick's Lunchbox Service" Drawing-a-Day Project

Nick Golebiewski has made a drawing each and every day as part of his "Nick's Lunchbox Service" drawing-a-day project, since Jan 1, 2014. In the pandemic, Nick started adding watercolor to his daily sketches. This daily practice is about the act of making an artwork everyday, it is a ritual, and a way to pause and observe a detail of the world in a more attentive way.

## Project rules:

1. Drawing must be made that day.
2. Drawing must be photographed on site.
3. Then posted online.
